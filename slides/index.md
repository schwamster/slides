### What is Aurelia?

![FsReveal](images/main-logo.svg)

V1 since 27th of July 2016

***

### Why bother?

- NG1 is from 2010, most of the akward ways are obsolete (ES2015/2016)
- Steep learning curve and litte team knowglede present
- Known Performance issues - watchers (obsolete dirty checking)
- techical debt build up since 2010
' modules, pure HTML5 custom (web) components, shadow DOM that, two-way data binding using Object.observe.
' new concepts:one-time data binding, controllerAs, bindToController - old concepts like $scope

=> Still have time to change!

***

### Aurelia is/has
- a medium size framework with no external dependencies.
- as fast or faster than all other frameworks.
- more standards compliant than most other frameworks.
- he most unobstrusive framework today.
- integrates very well with other libraries. Other frameworks like Angular and React have a harder time with this.
- has the best support for separated presentation patterns (MVC, MVVM, MVP)
- is better at dynamic, data-driven UI construction than anything else today.
- is written in 100% ES 2015/2016, no dependencies except polyfills.
- no unnecessary DOM abstractions. faster and consume less memory
- some of the best support for Web Components.
- the only framework built with a modern, modular architecture.
